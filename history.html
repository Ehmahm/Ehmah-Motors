                    <h2>Tesla</h2>
                    <div class="history-details">
                        <span>Founded: 2003</span>

                    <p>Tesla, founded in 2003 in California by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, was bound to disrupt the automotive world by specializing in electric vehicles and renewable energy. It was named after the great inventor Nikola Tesla, thus joining the battle of rushing the world to switch towards renewable energy sources as quickly as possible. In its early days, it also welcomed an investor and subsequent CEO: Elon Musk. The first car produced was in 2008-the Tesla Roadster-but which then truly exemplified the capability that a high-performance electric could do, reach over 200 miles on one charge.</p>
                    <p>Things only got interesting with Tesla globally after the 2010s, especially with the Model S, an entirely electric sedan; subsequently came the Model X, an SUV; and last but not least, the Model 3 should be more 'affordable' being the recent sedan. These vehicles combined cutting-edge technology, long-range capabilities, and over-the-air software updates, redefining the modern driving experience. Tesla also made significant advancements in battery technology and established a vast Supercharger network to support long-distance EV travel. The companyâ€™s gigafactories further revolutionized battery production and scaled EV manufacturing to meet increasing demand.</p>
                    <p>Beyond vehicles, Tesla expanded into energy solutions, including products like Powerwall, Powerpack, and solar panels, which address energy storage and generation for homes and businesses. In recent years, Tesla has stayed at the front of innovation, working on projects such as autonomous driving technology and the recent unveiling of the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi. As a pioneering EV maker, Tesla is still leading the charge into a sustainable transportation future and impressing the auto sector to move toward cleaner and greener alternatives.</p>

                    <h2>Toyota</h2>
                    <div class="history-details">
                        <span>Founded: 1937</span>
                    </div>
                    <p>Born in 1937, Toyota Kiichiro Toyoda emerged in Japan from within the bowels of Textile Machinery Group Company Toyoda Automatic Loom Works Ltd. Into automotive manufacture came the giant when it was initiated with its product, Model AA, into being set to usher new times in travel as a developer and manufacturer. In the meantime, World War II shifted the company's focus toward manufacturing trucks for Japan's military, but afterward, passenger car production resumed, with the now-legendary Toyota Crown appearing in 1955. It was the first Japanese car to be exported to the United States, the first step toward Toyota's global expansion.</p>
                    <p>In the 1960s and 1970s, Toyota gained a worldwide reputation for constructing sturdy, fuel-efficient, reasonably-priced automobiles. Models such as the Toyota Corolla, launched in 1966, gained bestseller status across the globe and further strengthened Toyota's leading position in the car market. Besides, the company introduced lean manufacturing and just-in-time production systems that revolutionized the industry by greatly improving efficiency and waste reduction. At the end of the 20th century, Toyota continued to expand globally with the establishment of manufacturing plants first in North America and then in Europe, among other places.</p>
                    <p>Into the 21st century, Toyota continued to innovate, especially in sustainable and advanced vehicle technologies. In fact, the world's first mass production of hybrid vehicles was the launch of the Toyota Prius back in 1997 and has since sealed the company's pledge to environmental stewardship. Currently, Toyota is on the frontline in the production of electric and hydrogen-powered cars while remaining one of the world's largest automakers. Innovation, quality, and reliability remain the legacy with which Toyota stands out as a benchmark in the automotive industry.</p>

                    <h2>Mercedes</h2>
                    <div class="history-details">

                    </div>
                    <p>Mercedes-Benz was founded in 1926, but its origins go back to the late 19th century when Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler invented the automobile. In 1886, Karl Benz designed the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, now regarded as the first true automobile, while Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach developed the first petroleum-based engine. The company Mercedes-Benz was born from the merger between Benz & Cie and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft (DMG), combining their engineering and innovative skills. The brand "Mercedes" was derived from a series of DMG cars named after Mercedes Jellinek, who was the daughter of a powerful motorcar dealer.</p>
                    <p>During the 20th century, Mercedes-Benz certainly became synonymous with luxury, quality, and innovation. Several pioneering automotive technologies were introduced, which included the crumple zone for crash safety, ABS, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Gullwing, S-Class icons in design and engineering. It has been since long considered among the benchmark varieties of sedans in the lines of luxury car manufacture; these often set precedence for advanced features in its class.</p>
                    <p>Moving into the 21st century, Mercedes-Benz is continuously evolving toward leading in luxury and innovative ways by embracing the shift toward sustainability. The company has invested in electric mobility with its line of electric vehicles, which includes the EQS and the EQB. It is striving to achieve carbon neutrality by 2039. Mercedes-Benz also pioneers technologies in autonomous driving and continues its portfolio of high-performance vehicles under the AMG brand. At Mercedes-Benz, over a century of heritage befits excellence in the automotive sector by merging tradition with forward-thinking innovation.</p>
